The Linux Foundation  
Effective July 12, 2018 / Last amended October 7, 2020

<li>The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status.</li>

<li>The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have an Outreach Committee, Technical Advisory Counsel, Budget Committee, Legal Committee and other working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively, “Committees”) that may be established by the Governing Board.
